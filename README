# Toggle Location Widget #
##########################

Android widget to switch the available location providers on and off.

While you sometimes need applications accessing your location to enable certain features, most of the time when you are using your phone those applications do not need to access that information.
This widget allows you to easily switch the phone location services on and off, and to share your location with the applications only when you are willing to.

# Installation instructions #
#############################

In order to install the application you will need to install the Android SDK.
Once installed, connect your phone to your computer and use the adb tool to push the application on your phone.
Default location of the adb tool is in the "platform-tools/adb" directory of the Android SDK.
To push the application on your phone, compile it into an APK and simply run the following commands :
**************************************************
adb remount
adb push ToggleLocationWidget.apk /system/app/
**************************************************

If you wish to remove the application from your phone, run the following command :
**************************************************
adb shell rm /system/app/ToggleLocationWidget.apk
**************************************************

The reason why the application should be manually pushed in the /system/app directory of the phone is because it uses two permissions that are not allowed for downloaded APKs.
Those two permissions are "android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS" and "android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS", and are used to modify the system's settings.
